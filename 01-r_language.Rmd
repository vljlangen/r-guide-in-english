# R language

**R** is a programming language that you can install on your computer **for free** and with which you can make **not only statistical analyses but also graphs** when preparing a scientific article.

If the researcher's choice is free, I dare to recommend nowadays that a novice researcher starts directly with R. Even if you already know e.g. SAS or SPSS, it's worth learning a little bit of R just to create graphs with it

Advantages of R:

1. free
2. easy installation
3. lightweight - takes up little space on the computer
3. you can get help quickly and easily from the internet
4. excellent for making graphs
5. sufficient without other software for the analyzes of a standard dissertation

In my opinion, R language is in its bare-bones format (the so-called Base-R) a bit difficult and non-human-readable.

But when R code is made with an add-on, the so-called *dplyr* package, the code is very easy to read and write even for a beginner.

This quick guide aims to do most everything with the *dplyr* package, which will be introduced more in detail later in this guide.
