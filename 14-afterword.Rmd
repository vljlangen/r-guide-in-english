# Afterword

We covered the basic building blocks above to create your dataset, how to look at the variables in it, do cross-tabulations and graphs and even regression analysis. You can copy-paste code from this quick guide into your own projects.

The Internet is full of R guides, and you will no doubt want to familiarize yourself with them next.

If and when coding with R sometimes leaves you feeling lost, you should ask help from [Stack Overflow (SO)](https://stackoverflow.com/). Creating a username there is free. If you can't find an answer to your question by browsing SO, you can ask it yourself there. You will usually receive an answer within a few hours. The answers show the genius of experienced coders that is hard not to admire. And just like using R and RStudio, SO is completely free.
